    "Description": "SkyeMeter connects to IINACT to display real-time DPS, HPS, and encounter statistics with a customizable ImGui interface. Features include pet damage merging, dual DPS/HPS tables, history tracking, and extensive visual customization. Additionally, we calculate the actual healing done, instead of merging healing and overhealing, for a REAL display of the healing done by each Combatant.",
